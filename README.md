# Damien-Hirst-spot-painting
Python program that generates famous Damien Hirst's spot paintings
This code generates a painting in the style of the artist Damien Hirst using Python's Turtle graphics library. The colors used in the painting are derived from an image using the colorgram library.

The painting consists of 100 dots arranged in a grid pattern, with each dot randomly colored from a list of pre-defined colors. The dots are spaced 50 units apart, and every 10 dots, the turtle moves up 50 units and then moves back to the left-hand side of the screen to continue painting.

The result is a colorful and abstract composition that resembles the spot paintings for which Hirst is famous.
